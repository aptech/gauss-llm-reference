# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** Every function in the Command Reference must have an accurate signature, correct examples, and be reachable from navigation
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Cross-Reference Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Cross-Reference Validation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-14 — Completed 02-01 (Sphinx Environment Loader)

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 12 min | 4 min |
| 02 | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7 min), 01-02 (3 min), 01-03 (2 min), 02-01 (2 min)
- Trend: improving

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Two-engine parsing approach -- docutils for fast structural checks (Phase 1), Sphinx environment for cross-reference resolution (Phase 2)
- [Roadmap]: Terminology enforcement and deep validation deferred to v2
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (AI Reviews) depends on Phase 1 only, not Phase 2/3, enabling parallel work if needed
- [01-01]: Used findall() over deprecated traverse() for docutils 0.22.4 compatibility
- [01-01]: Extract fields from system_message literal_blocks for Sphinx directive fallback (.. function::)
- [01-01]: Empty code block detection via AST has a limitation; STRC-02 checker may need raw source analysis supplement
- [01-02]: Signature detection parses .. function:: from system_message literal_blocks (docutils treats Sphinx directives as unknown)
- [01-02]: Operator pages excluded from signature checks (use Parameters/Returns sections, not :param: fields)
- [01-03]: Used no_color=True for Rich Console in tests to avoid ANSI escape codes breaking string assertions
- [02-01]: Sphinx dummy builder with freshenv=True for clean environment on each load

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Sphinx 9.x Python API compatibility with custom GAUSS domain needs early verification in Phase 2
